# Blunt
Blunt is an auxiliary tool for subtitle files. It combines subtitles exported from platforms like [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) or [Azure AI](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/captioning) with the original manuscript for comparison, ultimately generating a more accurate subtitle file that matches the content better.

## Setup

    pip install git+https://github.com/t2og/blunt.git
